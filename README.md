# Full Stack RAG Chatbot for Documentation Assistance

Engineered a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI chatbot using Streamlit for documentation assistance. Ingested documents with OpenAI Embeddings and Pinecone vector store for efficient retrieval. Utilized LangChain to rephrase user queries (preserving chat history), fetch relevant context, and integrated GPT-4 to generate accurate, context-aware responses.
